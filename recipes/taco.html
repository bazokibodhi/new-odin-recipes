    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The taco salad is made with taco-seasoned ground lamb, chilli beans, and
      tomatoes combined with cheese and crunchy tortilla chips for a tasty twist
      on regular taco salad. The children have fun preparing all the extras
      before we mix it all together. Serve on lettuce and top with salsa and
      sour cream.
