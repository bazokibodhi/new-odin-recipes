    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Hyderabadi Dum Biryani is a richly flavoured rice dish cooked in layers,
      known for it's aromatic spices and tender meat (often chicken or goat)
      that is marinated and slow-cooked with long-grain basmati rice on "dum"
      (sealed cooking). The unique cooking method which involves layering par-
      cooked rice and marinated meat in a sealed pot and cooking it in it's own
      juices and steam, allows the flavours to meld, and creates a fragrant,
      deeply flavourful dish originating from the kitchens of nizam of
      Hyderabad.
