    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A chicken burger the whole family enjoys! Natasha is my eldest daughter
      and her eyes light when I announce we're having these for dinner. The
      onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids we prefer grating so as
      to hide it. I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caeser salad
      for a very comforting meal!!
